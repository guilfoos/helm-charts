# helm-charts
Repository for any helm charts I needed to create.

- [Helm Repo](https://guilfoos.github.io/helm-charts/)
- [Git Repo](https://github.com/guilfoos/helm-charts)

As of right now, there are no working charts in this repo. Additionally, any charts that are working, have only been tested in my homelab and may not be suitable for use elsewhere. Still, I make them available for others. I am no kubernetes, helm, or git expert! Whatever I do here is mostly hacked together through trial and error to work in my environment.

Charts:
 - faster-whisper. A packaging of the linuxserver gpu-enabled distribution of faster-whisper.

Special thanks to drinkataco, whose [Media-Servarr](https://github.com/drinkataco/media-servarr/) charts served as a source of inspiration for the Github Actions that make this thing work.
